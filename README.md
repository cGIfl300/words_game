I do use python 3.10.0 on Windows 11 French Home Edition  
## Extra-infos  
I planned to use a Wiki as documentation support: this is difinitly not a good idea:  
- I can't do ducumentation on a wiki using my IDE, I do mainly use [vscodium](https://vscodium.com/)  
- That increase the complexity of backup (everything is backed up in real time if I don't use a wiki)  
- A wiki is not that flexible comparing to a well agenced .MD files folders collection  

Have fun, enjoy and share.
